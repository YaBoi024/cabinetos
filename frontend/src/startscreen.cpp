//
// docs/PROJECT.md, "The icon has two variants and the second one is earned":
// the warm-screened cabinet with the lit power switch marks a platform that
// runs more emulators at full power. Cabinet's Mac app had it; CabinetOS
// earned it with PlayStation 2 and GameCube. So this console draws THAT one,
// not the cyan version `tools/make_icon.swift` generates.
//
// Five rounded rectangles and four circles, which is all the icon is. Drawn
// means sharp at any panel size, no image asset in the OS image, and the
// marquee and screen can be animated later — which is what the boot splash
// wants when somebody builds it.
//
// The numbers are the icon's own, in its 1024 space, sampled from
// AppIconMac.appiconset because that PNG was then the only definition of
// the Afterburner variant. `s` scales that space; `ox`/`oy` place it.

    // A GRADIENT IS A TEXTURE, NOT A STACK OF RECTANGLES.

    // The first two attempts drew the ramps as 3 and then 30 strips, because
    // this renderer has no gradient rect. Both read as corduroy — MMagTech:
    // *"that looks really bad"* — and the second one looked worse than the
    // first, because thirty seams are more obviously wrong than two. Widening
    // the overlap to two device pixels did not help either, which was the clue
    // that the seam was not an overlap problem at all.
    //
    // The renderer already draws textured quads with linear filtering and a
    // rounded clip — `drawImage` and the QR code both use it. So the ramp is a
    // 64-texel texture and the GPU interpolates it: no seams, at any size,
    // because there are no interior edges to seam.
    //
    // It also makes the marquee animatable for free. A sweep of light across
    // it is `u0`/`u1` moving over time, which is what the boot splash in
    // docs/PROJECT.md describes when it says the marquee lights.
    // `vertical` makes the texture 1xN instead of Nx1. Rotating the quad's UVs
    // was the first attempt and it came out sideways AND reversed, which is a
    // lot of guessing about someone else's rotation convention to save four
