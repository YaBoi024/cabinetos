// --- Search -----------------------------------------------------------------

// MMagTech, 2026-09-21: *"we also need to implement the search as well."* The
// bar has said "Search" since the bar existed and pressing it printed a line to
// stderr saying it was not built.
//
// IT ASKS THE SERVER — changed 2026-09-22, open question 28.
//
// It used to filter a catalogue held in memory, on the grounds that the whole
// library was loaded at boot anyway so a substring match was free. That was
// true, and the reason it was true is exactly what open question 28 removed:
// boot no longer fetches sixteen hundred games, so there is nothing here to
// filter. `/api/roms` takes `search_term`, checked against the live server.
//
// THE OLD COMMENT ALSO ARGUED THAT ASKING THE SERVER WOULD BE "THE ONE SCREEN
// IN THE PRODUCT THAT STOPS WORKING OFFLINE", AND THAT WAS WRONG. Nothing is
// kept between boots but three config files, so an offline boot has no
// catalogue in memory either and this screen has always filtered an empty
// vector with no server. Nobody noticed because the startup screen waits for
// the server and Search is never reached. See open question 28's offline
// section, and 29 for what offline actually means here.
//
// THE OTHER HALF OF THAT COMMENT STANDS: this needs debouncing, which the
// substring filter did not. The keyboard is docked and the results are live,
// so without it every keystroke is a request.
//
// THE KEYBOARD IS DOCKED AND THE RESULTS ARE LIVE. Typing blind and pressing
// Done to find out what you got is the thing that makes console search
// miserable; see ui::Keyboard::Config::dockedBottom for what that cost.
