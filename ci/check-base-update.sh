# Check whether the pinned Bazzite base has moved, and work out whether the move
# matters to CabinetOS.
#
# Bazzite rebuilds daily. A dependency bot pointed at it would open a pull
# request every day, and a pull request that arrives every day stops being read.
# So this does five things a bot cannot:
#
#   1. Compares the package manifest of the new base against the one committed
#      at the last bump, so the PR says what actually changed rather than just
#      "digest moved".
#   2. Classifies that change against ci/base-watch.txt — the packages CabinetOS
#      relies on, in areas — and labels the result RELEVANT or ROUTINE. Since
#      2026-10-09 ci/base-report.py does this part, and writes what a person
#      reads: update notes that also serve as the public ones, the checks for
#      the changed areas only (the Deck's log, and by hand), and the kernel's
#      fixes for the parts the console uses.
#   3. Flags strip-list drift: removal targets in build_files/ that no longer
#      exist in the base, which means a strip script has silently become a
#      no-op and a desktop application may be creeping back in.
#   4. Checks the new gamescope still takes every flag cabinetos-session
#      and Steam's first download (cabinetos-steam-download) pass it
#      (ci/check-gamescope-flags.sh, #227). One gone makes the update
#      RELEVANT and says which, before it can reach a television; a check
#      that could not tell says why (no --help, or the reading broke), in
#      the pull request and in the run's summary.
#   5. Checks the builders still start from the base's Fedora release: the
#      frontend's and the PCSX2, Cemu and Sunshine builders' `FROM
#      fedora:NN`, and Sunshine's fc44 package name. A base on a newer Fedora
#      makes the update RELEVANT and names the files that must move with it.
#
# Writes to the working directory:
#   base-manifest.txt   the new base's package list (committed with the bump)
#   /tmp/pr-body.md     the pull request body
#   /tmp/base-notes.md  the update notes alone (the bump's commit message)
#
# Sets these outputs when running under GitHub Actions:
#   changed, relevant, new_version, summary, gamescope (ok, missing; or not
#   checked: no-help, its --help did not run; too-few, the reading broke;
#   failed, the check stopped)
